# Hade Sans and Hade Serif
### 派手字体
Hade Jitai (refers to the entire project) is a Japanese typeface in progress.
It aims for simplicity by using a more geometric, "angular" design.
The goal of this project is not to replicate handwriting, rather, it is to provide another option to the rather limited set of Japanese typefaces.

*Little disclaimer for y'all:
I am not Japanese nor am I fluent in the language.
The latter is currently in progress.
I am extremely beginner in terms of my knowledge of Japanese culture and its language.
This project is actually as a way for me to slowly learn Japanese whilst making it more interesting to me, by making it a project.*

## The Name
The name, at least I think it means, "Shiny Font".
Which is purely because yes.
If that is not actually what that means, ***please*** let me know so I can make corrections. That applies to everything here. I would much rather know that I did something wrong than not know in the first place.

## Hade Sans
Hade Sans is the more simplistic of the two typefaces. It has smooth edges and a rounder design. It is also made to blend nicely with its counterpart, Hade Serif.

## Hade Serif 
Hade Serif is closer to the original handwritten characters. It contains serifs and bumps to give it more character. It also looks more professional than its counterpart, and could work nicely with headers.
